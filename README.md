_Classic Editor, WooCommerce, and Custom Post Type support included._

Tested with WordPress 5.9, but WP 5.8 and below Support is also included.

### USAGE

Once you install and activate the plugin, you can go to any post or page and create a new gallery.

Then depending if you are using the _Block or Classic Editor_, you will see an additional meta box or panel, with the title _Gallery Slider Options_ on the sidebar.

There is one significant difference for the Classic and Block editor users.

**For Classic Editor, once you enable the plugin, the sliders will be applied to ALL the galleries on the current page or post.**

While if you are using the Block Editor, you can select sliders functionality for each gallery individually.

There are two steps involved. While on with Block Editor, you only need to select the _Container_ wrap size to be active in the gallery slider.

To remove the slider functionality, you need to select the **default** option from the select dropdown.

_Note: The gallery slider container width is relative to the parent container, and it will always fit the parent if its size is less than the selected one._

### FEATURES

You have almost total control over the plugin except for the styling and transitions.

1. Plain Gallery to Fancy Sliders - convert your built-in WordPress galleries into sliders with a modal preview.
2. Multi-editor Support - works with both Classic and Block editors.
3. Choose you Container Size - select from several different container sizes from 540px to 1680px (_full browser width is also included as an option_)
4. Backward Compatibility - there was a major change in the gallery structure in WordPress 5.9, but the plugin also supports WordPress 5.8 below.
5. Full Block Editor Support - if you are using the Block editor, you preview what your gallery sliders will look like on the front-end.
6. Switch Sliders ON/OFF - You can ultimately enable/disable the plugin from the settings page on the front-end.
7. WooCommerce Products and CPT Support - You can use the WooCommerce and Custom Post Types plugin if enabled from the settings page.
